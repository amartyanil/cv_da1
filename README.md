# Computer Vision Digital Assignment 1

This contains some of the solutions to the computer vision implementations for an assignment given in our class. Here is a list of what things are there in this repo.
* Point Detection
* Line Detection
* Edge Detection
  - Robert's cross gradient operator
  - Prewitt's Operator
* Chain Code Generator (code is faulty)

For using the codes, the images are to be placed in the directory and the filenames are to be changed accordingly.
